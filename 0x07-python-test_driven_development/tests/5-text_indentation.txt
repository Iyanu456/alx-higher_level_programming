How to use 5-text_indentation.py
================================

This module defines a text_indentation function
``text_indentation(text)``.

Usage:
======
``text_indentation(...)`` prints a text with two new lines after each of 
these characters: ``., ?, :``

::

	>>> text_indentation = __import__("5-text_indentation").text_indentation
	
	>>> text_indentation("Hello?")
	Hello?
	<BLANKLINE>
	
No spaces are printed at the beginning of a line

::

	>>> text_indentation("    Hello.")
	Hello.
	<BLANKLINE>

::

	>>> text_indentation("      ")


Similarly, no spaces are printed at the end of a line

::

	>>> text_indentation("John Doe.    ")
	John Doe.
	<BLANKLINE>


	>>> text_indentation("I love to code. ALX is great, isn't it?")
	I love to code.
	<BLANKLINE>
	ALX is great, isn't it?
	<BLANKLINE>
